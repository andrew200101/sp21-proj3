# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

For this part, it took a while to realize how convenient tunnels are for the overall design. I also found that is it always great to use DMX and MUX's as it saved a whole lot of circuit rerouting and wasted time.

For addi my design choice kept things as simple as possible. I did not use components that weren't nesseccary and avoided the control logic altogether and instead inputted contants to save time.
